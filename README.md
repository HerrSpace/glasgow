# Don't use this

This is a fork of the [glasgow](http://glasgow-embedded.org/) project,
with the files I used to let JLCPCB manufacture and assemble a few
boards for myself.

This was mostly a project for me to learn more kicad and how to order
more complex projects from JLC, pick parts, etc.

I'm not an EE, I have no idea what I'm doing. Assume everything in
this fork is nonsense. Order original boards instead.
